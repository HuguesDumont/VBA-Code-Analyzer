# VBA-Tips

Anyone can use these functions, but please give me the credits when you do so.

In this repository you will find some functions and common screens I developed in VBA for Excel.
These functions are made to help developers in different situations, like for type conversion or sorting arrays.

You will also find a few utils like a converter for morse code (from morse code to text and reverse).
